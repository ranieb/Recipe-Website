    <h3> Description: </h3>
    <p><strong>Ovenbaked salmon</strong> is a wonderfully tasty dish,
    requiring only ingredients found in the average kitchen, yet coming together
    to produce a taste truly greater than the sum of its parts. It is also shockingly
    easy to make, requiring only 5 minutes of actual work, and 15 minutes in the oven. Pairs excellently with hash browns and cucumber salad.</p>

    <p>To make this <em>simple yet great-tasting</em> dish, simply follow the instructions below.</p>

    <h3>You will need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Salmon-filets, </li>
        <li>soy sauce, </li>
        <li>olive oil, </li>
        <li>lemon and </li>
        <li>salt and pepper. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set your oven to 140 degrees, preferably with hot-air, but the standard setting will also work. Lay the filets on a baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Apply a layer of soy sauce on the filets, preferably with a brush. Afterwards, drip gently with olive oil, and apply liberal amounts of salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Finally, squeeze your lemon onto the filets. Put the filets in the oven for 14 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Bon appetit!</strong>
